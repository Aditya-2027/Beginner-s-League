        b. reverse alphabetically
        c. by length :
            i. ascending
            ii. descending order,
    2. numbers:

What did you learn while making this app?
- I revised through the basics I learnt in high school

What feature did you enjoy building the most?
- Trying out many ways to sort

What would you add next if you had more time?
- maybe a complex pattern to sort the items. Maybe even combine both numbers and words.
